## Why is it important?
Plant photosynthesis is part of the carbon cycle. Plant use energy from sunlight to combine CO2 and H2O to form carbohydrates. Oxygen O2 is released as a byproduct.

## NDVI

## Photosynthesis
### Calvin cycle - C3 pathway
CO2 is added to a phosphorylated 5-carbon sugar, ribulose biphosphate. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme ribulose biphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RUBISCO). The resulting 6-carbon compoung breaks down into 2 molecules of 3-phosphoglyceric acid (PGA). These are used to produce gulcose and other food.
### Photorespiration
RUBISCO can also add O2 to ribulose biphosphate liberating CO2 in the process. High light intensities and high ]temperatures (above ~ 30 C) favor this process over photosynthesis.
### C4 plants
C4 plant minimize losses to photorespiration. In mesophyll cells of C4 plants CO2 is added to 3-carbon phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) to form 4-carbon oxaloacetic acid (C4).This is converted to malic or aspartic acid and tranported into a bundle sheath cell. These cells are often deep in the leaf with low levels of oxygen. In the sheath cells the 4-carbon acids are broken down into CO2 which enters the Calvin cycle or pyruvic acid which is transported back to a mesophyll cell where it is converted back into PEP.
 * crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants segregate C4 and C3 pathways in time
 - at night they take in CO2 through their stomata and produce malic acid
 - in the morning stomata close and malic acid is broken down to release CO2 to the Calvin (C3) cycle
 - cacti, Bryophyllum, pineapple, sedums, "ice plant" are well adapted to high temperatures and sunlight and low moisture
 * other plants segregate these pathways in different parts of the leaf
 - tobacco has C4 cells near veins
