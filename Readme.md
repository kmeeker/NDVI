NoIR Plant Photosynthesis Measurement
================

take a NDVI picture of a plant to measure its photosynthesis
------------------------------------------------------------

A Raspberry Pi with NoIR camera can be used to measure photosynthesis in plants. The NoIR camera has its infrared block filter removed. The addition of a filter to block red light, allows the "red" channel of the camera to instead measure "near-infrared" light. Since chlorophyll absorbs blue and red light, but not green or infrared. The difference in reflection of infrared and blue light from a plant indicates the amount of photosynthesis. Photos from the NOIR camera with red block filter can be processed into false-colored "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index" (NDVI) images using a free online tool, Infragram by Public Lab.
